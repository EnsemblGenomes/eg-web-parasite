<h2>About <em>Meloidogyne incognita</em></h2>
<p>The nematode <em>Meloidogyne incognita</em>, also known as the southern root-knot nematode, is able to infect the roots of almost all cultivated plants. It is an obligatory sedentary parasite that reproduces by mitotic parthenogenesis. <em>M. incognita</em> can infect <em>Arabidopsis&nbsp;thaliana</em>, making it a key model system for the understanding of metazoan adaptations to plant parasitism.</p>
