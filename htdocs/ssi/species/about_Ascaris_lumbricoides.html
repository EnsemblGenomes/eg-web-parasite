<h2>About <em>Ascaris lumbricoides</em></h2>
<p>The nematode <em>Ascaris&nbsp;lumbricoides</em>, or human large roundworm, infects the small intestine of humans. It occurs worldwide and is the most common human parasitic infection. It is transmitted by contaminated soil and water and is therefore prevalent in areas of poor sanitation. People infected with multiple worms experience diarrhoea, abdominal pain, general malaise and weakness. These symptoms can affect peoples ability to work and learn, and can impair physical growth.</p>
