<h2>Assembly</h2>
<p>The <em>S.&nbsp;mansoni</em> genome was sequenced by a consortium led by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, as described by <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19606141">Berriman et al (2009)</a>.  The assembly version represented here is the v5.0 freeze from <a href="http://www.genedb.org/Homepage/Hmicrostoma">GeneDB</a> (December 2013), and is practically the same as INSDC assembly <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000237925.2">GCA_000237925.2</a>, with scaffold gap sizes the only difference.</p>
