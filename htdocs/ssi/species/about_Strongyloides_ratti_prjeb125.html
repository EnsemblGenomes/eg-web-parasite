<h2>Assembly</h2>
<p>The reference genome was assembled by the  <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/">Parasite Genomic group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>, in collaboration with Mark Viney (University of Bristol), using a combination of capillary, 454 and Illumina paired-end sequence and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19887089/">genetic map</a> data, and improved using bespoke manual and automated tools (WTSI Strongyloididae Nematode Genomes Project, unpublished).</p>

<h2>Annotation</h2>
<p>The genome was annotated by the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/">Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> as part of the Strongyloididae Nematode Genomes Project (unpublished). In in-house automatic pipeline (based around <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22192575">MAKER</a>) was used to generate first-pass gene models, and this was followed by a round of targeted manual curation of selected gene families.</p>
