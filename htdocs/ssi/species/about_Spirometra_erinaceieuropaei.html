<h2>About <em>Spirometra erinaceieuropaei</em></h2>
<p>The cestode <em>Spirometra&nbsp;erinaceieuropaei</em> infects domestic animals and humans. This larva may be directly ingested by humans or may enter an intermediate host which include frogs, birds, snakes, rats and mice and become a plerocercoid larva causing an infection called sparganosis. Because humans would normally ingest the worm at the procercoid stage the human is a dead-end host.</p>
