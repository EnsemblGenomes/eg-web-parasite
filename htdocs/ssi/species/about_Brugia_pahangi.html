<h2>About <em>Brugia pahangi</em></h2>
<p><em>Brugia pahangi</em> is a filarial parasite that is transmitted to domestic cats and dogs in South East Asia when infected mosquitoes take a blood meal. It is used as a model for filarial infections because it is relatively easy to maintain the laboratory. It is closely related to the human parasite <em>Brugia&nbsp;malayi</em> and studies suggest that it may be zoonotic, developing to maturity in humans. </p>
