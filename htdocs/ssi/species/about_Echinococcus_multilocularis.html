<h2>About <em>Echinococcus multilocularis</em></h2>
<p>The cestode <em>Echinococcus multilocularis</em> is a member of the Cyclophyllidea, which comprise the majority of tapeworms that are of medical importance. The disease alveolar echinococcosis, which is caused by the larval stage of <em>E. multilocularis</em>, is considered to be one of the most dangerous worm infections in the world. <em>E.&nbsp;multilocularis</em> has recently spread in Europe, Japan, and North America to areas that were previously free of the parasite leading to the classification of alveolar echinococcosis as an emerging zoonosis.</p>
