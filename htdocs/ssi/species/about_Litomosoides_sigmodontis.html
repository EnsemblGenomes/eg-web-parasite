<h2>About <em>Litomosoides sigmodontis</em></h2>
<p>The nematode <em>Litomosoides&nbsp;sigmodontis</em> is a filarial parasite of rodents. Found in cotton rats in the wild infecting the pleral cavity. It has been adapted to the laboratory mouse and is widely used as a model for human filariases. This model has become central in efforts to develop vaccines against filarial infections, test new drugs before they are progressed to clinical trials, and to investigate the basic biology of the interactions between parasitic nematodes and their mammalian hosts.</p>
