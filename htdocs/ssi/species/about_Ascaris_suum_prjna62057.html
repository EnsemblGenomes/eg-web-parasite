<h2>Assembly</h2>
<p>The <em>A.&nbsp;suum</em> genome has been sequenced by the <a href="http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/departments/biochemistry/Faculty/PrimaryFaculty/Pages/Davis.aspx">Davis laboratory at the University of Colorado</a> in collaboration with the <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/people/groups/detail/mitreva-lab/">Mitreva laboratory at the Genome Institute of Washington University</a>, as described by <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23123092">Wang et al (2012)</a>.  The assembly represented here is the germ-line genome version nAs2.0, obtained from <a href="http://nematodes.org/genomes/ascaris_suum/">nematodes.org</a>. It is similar but not identical to the INSDC assembly <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000187025.2/">GCA_000187025.2</a> (contigs were clipped and filtered during the GenBank submission process).</p>
