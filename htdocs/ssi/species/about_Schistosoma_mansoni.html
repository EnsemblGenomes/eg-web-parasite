<h2>About <em>Schistosoma mansoni</em></h2>
<p>The trematode <em>Schistosoma&nbsp;mansoni</em> is one of the three major infectious agents responsible for the chronic debilitating disease schistosomiasis found throughout Africa and South America. The intermediate host for the parasite is a freshwater snail from the genus Biomphlaria, and the definitive host is a human. Schistosomiasis is widely considered to be second only to malaria as a global health problem and an incalculable drain on the economic development of endemic countries.</p>
