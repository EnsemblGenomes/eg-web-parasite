<h2>About <em>Dracunculus medinensis</em></h2>
<p>The nematode <em>Dracunculus medinensis</em> causes dracunculiasis, or Guinea Worm Disease (GWD) in remote areas of Africa without access to safe drinking water. Humans acquire the parasite when they drink water containing copepods infected with <em>D.&nbsp;medinensis</em> larvae. Nearly eradicated as a result of the Guinea Worm Eradication Programme, which reduced 3.5 million cases in 1986 to 148 cases in 2013, GWD has reemerged in Chad in 2010 after an absence of 2 years.</p>
