<h2>About <em>Romanomermis culicivorax</em></h2>
<p>The nematode <em>Romanomermis culicivorax</em> is an entomopathogenic parasite that invades larvae of various mosquito species killing these when emerging at the J4 stage. <em>R. culicivorax</em> is being tested as a biological pest control to fight malaria. Although only distantly related to <em>C.&nbsp;elegans</em> it has proved to be a particularly amenable study object for analyzing embryogenesis.</p>
