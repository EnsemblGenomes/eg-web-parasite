<h2>Assembly</h2>
<p>The reference genome was produced by the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/">Parasite Genomic group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> in collaboration with the Division of Parasitology at the <a href="http://www.miyazaki-u.ac.jp/english/">University of Miyazaki</a>, as part of the WTSI Strongyloididae Nematode Genomes Project, (unpublished).</p>

<h2>Annotation</h2>
<p>The genome was annotated by the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/">Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> in collaboration with the Division of Parasitology at the <a href="http://www.miyazaki-u.ac.jp/english/">University of Miyazaki</a>, as part of the Strongyloididae Nematode Genomes Project (unpublished). An in-house automatic pipeline (based around <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22192575">MAKER</a>) was used to generate first-pass gene models, and this was followed by a round of targeted manual curation of selected gene families.</p>
