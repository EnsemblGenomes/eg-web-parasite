<h2>Annotation</h2>
<p>The genome was annotated by the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/parasitegenomics/">Parasite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> in collaboration with <a href="http://www.ffpri.affrc.go.jp/en/">Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute</a>, as part of the Strongyloididae Nematode Genomes Project (unpublished). In in-house automatic pipeline (based around <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22192575">MAKER</a>) was used to generate first-pass gene models, and this was followed by a round of targeted manual curation of selected gene families. </p>
