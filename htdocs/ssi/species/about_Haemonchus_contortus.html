<h2>About <em>Haemonchus contortus</em></h2>
<p>The nematode <em>Haemonchus contortus</em>, or red stomach worm, wire worm or Barber's pole worm, is an animal endoparasite infecting wild and domesticated ruminants (including sheep and goats) worldwide. It is a very common parasite and one the most pathogenic nematodes of ruminants. Adult worms are attached to abomasal mucosa and feed on the blood. <em>H.&nbsp;contortus</em> is a close relative of the human hookworm species which makes it an important model of parasitic nematode biology that is commonly used for experimental studies.</p>
