<h2>About <em>Onchocerca volvulus</em></h2>
<p>The nematode <em>Onchocerca volvulus</em> is a gonochoristic filarial parasite of humans causing Onchocerciasis. Onchocerciasis, or River Blindness, is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) which affects over 37 million people, mainly in Africa. It is a severely debilitating disease, which is transmitted to humans by the bite of Simulium blackflies that live and breed near fast-flowing streams and rivers.</p>

<h2>Annotation</h2>
<p>The Parasite genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute have collaborated with WormBase to produce first pass annotation of the genome, using MAKER2 <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22192575">[PMID:22192575]</a>. WormBase has taken on responsibility for the manual curation of the gene set, and we welcome feedback from the <em>Onchocerca</em> community in order to help identify and prioritise curation targets.</p>

<h2>Assembly</h2>
<p>The reference genome for <em>Onchocerca volvulus</em> has been produced by the Parasite Genomics team at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. A combination of deep sequencing and optical mapping was used on material from a single adult worm from the Republic of Cameroon.</p>
