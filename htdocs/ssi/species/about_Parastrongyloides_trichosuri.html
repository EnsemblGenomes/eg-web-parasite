<h2>About <em>Parastrongyloides trichosuri</em></h2>
<p>The nematode <em>Parastrongyloides trichosuri</em> is an intestinal parasite of Australian Brush-tailed possums. This parasite has the capacity to undergo multiple reproductive cycles as a free-living worm and thereby amplify the numbers of its infective L3s in faeces. This unique feature makes <em>P.&nbsp;trichosuri</em> a model for studies that explore the genetic basis of longevity and parasitism.</p>
