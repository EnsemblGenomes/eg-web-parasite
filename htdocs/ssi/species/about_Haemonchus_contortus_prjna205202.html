<h2>Assembly</h2>
<p>The <em>H.&nbsp;contortus</em> genome was sequenced by the <a href="http://www.gasserlab.org/">Gasser laboratory at the University of Melbourne</a>, as described by <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23985341">Schwarz et al (2013)</a>. The version of the genome represented here is that submitted directly to WormBase in 2013, which is similar to, but not exactly the same as, NCBI assembly <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000442195.1">GCA_000442195.1</a></p>
