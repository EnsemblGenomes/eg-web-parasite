<h2>About <em>Acanthocheilonema viteae</em></h2>
<p>The nematode <em>Acanthocheilonema viteae</em> is a filarial parasite of rodents. It is widely used as a model for human filariases. Importantly, <em>A.&nbsp;viteae</em> lacks the Wolbachia bacterial endosymbiont found in most human-infective filarial nematodes. Thus this species has become central in efforts to understand the role of the Wolbachia in the nematode-bacterial symbiosis, and in particular its possible role in immune evasion. </p>
